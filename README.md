# CPlusPlusTesting
This is my personal repository where I test my c++ skils or learn new ideas
Everything here is compiled in the `g++` compiler for *nix.
You can get g++ compiler by running (`sudo`) `apt-get install g++` while on debian based linux distros.
Chances are the code written in here doesn't follow c++ reccomended principles.
